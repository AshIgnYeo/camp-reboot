# Ruby and ActiveRecord

to start the challenge, run the following code in your terminal

```
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/camp-reboot/01-ruby-and-active-record
bundle install
RACK_ENV=test rake
```

### Instructions

As there wasn't enough time for a full set up, the tests are going to be run differently. To run the test suite, type `RACK_ENV=test rake` in your terminal. If you forget, don't worry I've made the terminal scream at you. The rake will drop and spin up it's own test database and run the migrations you wrote. Don't worry about all the output that you will see in the terminal.

For this challenge, we are going to have a recap on our `ruby` and `OOP` basics along with `ActiveRecord` to start. Remember them? Probably not.

To play the game we need `Pokemon`, and to identify who each pokemon belongs to, we need them to belong to a `Player`. To Track all the games, both players will belong to a `Game`. So we have this structure:

```
                                Game
                      ____________|_______________
                      |                          |
                    Player                    Player
        ______________|______               _____|______________
        |         |         |              |         |         |
      Pokemon   Pokemon   Pokemon        Pokemon   Pokemon   Pokemon
```

Which translates to a `Game` has many `Players`, and a `Player` has many `Pokemons`.

# Our Database

Let's create our db migration files in `db/migrate` to match the following diagram
![Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 7 12 28 AM](https://github.com/AshIgnYeo/camp-reboot/assets/65697575/bd30985f-e126-4b44-a379-ada987a868e2)

Some helper methods for you, but please **read the note below before starting to use them!**

```
rake db:create                             # creates the databases for you
rake db:create_migration [NAME=method]     # creates a migration file for you
rake db:migrate                            # run your migration files in the development environment
rake db:drop:dev                           # drop the development database
```

‚ö†Ô∏è to use the `rake db:create_migration` helper, you have to specify the name of the method you will run. e.g. to create posts, you would run `rake db:create_migration NAME=create_posts`. This will help you create the timestamps and method name accordingly. But you will still need to create your activerecord method.

# Our Models

We will create our models in the `app/models/` folder. We don't have to change anything else for this challenge

### Game

This one is simple, we don't need any properties. We just need the `id`, and that's automatically generated for us. We just need to tag our associations appropriately.

### Player

Also a relatively simple one. We just need to get our associations right and have a column in our database for a name.

### Pokemon

It wouldn't stay easy for long would it? Our pokemon needs to initialise with a few properties. `name`, `health`, `damage`, `defence`, `speed`, and also an `image` which will be stored as a string.

#### Pokemon methods

Methods help to clean up our code and make them a lot more readable, it also can help us to write some logic to reuse. As our pokemons are going into battle, let's write some methods that can help the funcionality.

##### #attack

To make the game more interesting, when we attack, we attack based on the `damage` attribute of the pokemon, but we also want to vary it a bit. Write a method that will return an Integer that is plus/minus 10 of the damage.
e.g. if the pokemons damage is `50`, `pokemon.attack` will return a number between 40 to 60.

##### #take_damage

Our pokemons are also going to take some damage, but that's what we have defence for! ‚õ® Our defence should be able to protect us from some damage. `take_damage` should reduce our damage by a random number, but that random number should never go above our defence!

Also we can't have a negetive HP. So the lowest we should ever go is 0. I believe that's sad enough.

##### #miss?

This is where speed is everything. The faster you are, the higher the chance `miss?` returns true.

We will be pulling from an API later. For that reason we need to cater to the values that are being received. Speed values range from `0` to `180`. So let's calculate a percentage

##### #ko?

All good? Great! Let's move on! üöÄ
